# Football-Stats

A Java-based program that analyzes football player statistics using linked lists to parse and process data.

##  Overview

**Football-Stats** loads football player data from a file, stores it in a custom linked-list data structure, and enables various queries to extract meaningful insights such as:

- Retrieving the top scorer(s)
- Finding players with the most assists or clean sheets
- Filtering by specific criteria (e.g., position, team)

This project demonstrates the application of linked list data structures, OOP design, file I/O, and basic algorithmic analysis in Java.

##  Features

- Custom singly linked list implementation in Java  
- Data loading from CSV or text files  
- Statistical computations:
  - Highest goal scorer
  - Most assists
  - Other configurable filters
- Easy extensibility for additional stats or data sources

##  Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher  
- (Optional but helpful) Maven or similar build tool
